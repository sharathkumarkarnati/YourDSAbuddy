# Time Complexity: O(n) - we only need to traverse the array once
# Space Complexity: O(n) - we store at most n elements in the hash map
\`\`\`

**Explanation:**
- We use a hash map to store each number and its index
- For each number, we calculate what complement we need to reach the target
- If the complement exists in our hash map, we've found our pair
- This approach gives us O(n) time complexity instead of O(nÂ²)`;

# Space Complexity: O(n) - we create a new string
\`\`\`

- We use two pointers starting from both ends
- We compare characters and move pointers inward
- If all characters match, it's a palindrome`;

# Space Complexity: O(1) - we only use a constant amount of extra space

    # - Hash maps for key-value lookups
    # - Trees for hierarchical data
